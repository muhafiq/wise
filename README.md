# WISE "Wounds Identification System"

The level of public knowledge about first aid procedures in Indonesia is relatively low.  Research by Hardyati (2024) shows that only 43-47% of individuals understand the first aid procedures. This problem will lead to many cases of incorrect treatment and increase the risk of serious complications. So, What solutions can we offer to make first aid knowledge more accessible and practical for everyone? To answer this problem, our team will develop an application to identify the type of external wound and provide guidance for treatment procedures. This application will also provide easily accessible information so that it can help us to give a quick response in emergency situations. Additionally, we also want to increase public knowledge about first aid guides through this application. Our final goal is to make first aid a common skill for everyone and not a skill that only experts can do.
